Designed for: XAUUSD, NASDAQ, EURUSD, GBPUSD
Timeframes: M5 / M15 for entries, H1 for direction
Market Type: Volatile + algorithmic quick reversals (typical Q4)

🧠 Core Idea

During Q4 2025, markets rotate fast because of:

Rate cuts & liquidity injections

Big institutions closing yearly positions

High algo activity

Volatility spikes around CPI, NFP, FOMC

This method catches the moment when liquidity grabs finish and price rotates back into the main direction.

🔥 ENTRY METHOD (VPR-Reversal)
1) Direction Filter (Higher Timeframe H1)

Use EMA 100

If price is above EMA 100 → Buy bias

If price is below EMA 100 → Sell bias

✔️ This avoids fighting the trend.

🎯 2) Entry Signal (M5/M15)

You enter after a liquidity grab + rotation + volume spike.

Conditions
BUY Conditions

Price creates a lower low (LL) but fails to close below it

Candle closes back inside previous range (false breakout)

Volume on the reversal candle > last 10 candles (VPR signal)

RSI on M5 < 30 and turning upward

➡️ Enter BUY at the close of the rotation candle

SELL Conditions

Price creates a higher high (HH) but fails to close above it

Candle closes back inside previous range

Volume on the reversal candle > last 10 candles

RSI on M5 > 70 and turning downward

➡️ Enter SELL at the close of the rotation candle

📌 3) Stop Loss (SL)

Very simple:

BUY SL: 8–15 pips below the liquidity grab low

SELL SL: 8–15 pips above the liquidity grab high

➡️ SL is always outside the manipulation zone, not inside.

🎯 4) Take Profit (TP)
Option 1 – Conservative

TP1: 1:1

TP2: 1:2

Move SL to break-even at TP1

Option 2 – Aggressive

Ride the EMA:

Exit when price touches EMA 50 M15

Great for NASDAQ and XAUUSD runners.

⚙️ 5) Extra Filters (Optional but powerful)
🔹 Fair Value Gap Confirmation (FVG)

If the rotation candle fills an FVG → signal stronger.

🔹 OB (Order Block) Retest

If reversal happens on a clean OB → high probability entry.

🔹 Session Timing Filter

Best times in Q4 2025:

London Open

New York Open

NY 14:30 gold + indices spike

Avoid:

Asian session

10 min before news

📊 FULL EXAMPLE (BUY)

Price makes a new low → candle closes back inside

Volume spike (highest in 10 candles)

RSI reversing from oversold

Price above EMA100 on H1 → buy bias

Enter buy

SL below the wick

TP according to plan

This catches the reversal before the breakout, not after.
Perfect for fast Q4 reversals.
