Act as a professional quantitative trading assistant. 
Analyze the RSI indicator and give me clear scenarios for Buy, Sell, or No Trade.

Use this structure:

1. CURRENT RSI ANALYSIS
- RSI value
- Overbought/Oversold status
- Momentum direction (increasing or decreasing)

2. MARKET CONTEXT
- Trend direction (uptrend, downtrend, ranging)
- Whether RSI confirms or contradicts price action

3. TRADE SETUPS
Give 3 scenarios:
A) RSI Breakout Setup (momentum)
B) RSI Reversal Setup (overbought/oversold bounce)
C) RSI Divergence Setup (bullish or bearish)

For each setup include:
- Entry level
- Stop-loss level
- Take-profit level
- Why the setup is valid
- Risk rating (Low / Medium / High)

4. DO NOT give financial advice.
Only describe technical setups and probabilities.

Here is the timeframe and asset I want you to analyze:
TIMEFRAME: 1 minute
ASSET: GOLD (XAUUSD)

Start by asking me for the current RSI value if I haven't provided it.
