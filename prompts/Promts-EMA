Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

Definition:
The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a moving average that gives more weight to recent price data, making it more responsive to current market conditions compared to the Simple Moving Average (SMA).

Formula:
EMA = (Price_today × Multiplier) + (EMA_previous × (1 − Multiplier))

Where:
Multiplier = 2 / (N + 1)
N = number of periods (for example, EMA 50 means N = 50)

Key Features:

Reacts faster to price changes

Useful for identifying trends

Helps generate signals when combined with other EMAs (for example, EMA 50 and EMA 200 crossovers)

Common EMA Settings:

EMA 9 or 10 for short-term momentum

EMA 20 for swing trading

EMA 50 for medium-term trend

EMA 200 for long-term trend
